# This is a package.conf template.
#
# The expected type is given for all keys that are not normal strings, with
# default values in parentheses. All listed keys need to be specified, even if
# left empty (running 'ktr verify' checks your .conf file for errors).
#
# Lists are expected to be comma-separated (comma only, no spaces!).
# Quasi-enums are given in parantheses, separated by forward slashes (choose
# one).
#
# Examples for .conf files can be found in the "examples" folder of the
# kentauros sources.
