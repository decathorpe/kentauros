# TODO items for kentauros

- ```package.__init__()```: make sure no hyphen is in source/version

- mock: use lockfile for waiting for running builds to finish?

- allow variables in package.conf and substitute
 - ```$(VERSION)```, ```$(NAME)```, etc.

- bzr: allow lightweight checkouts (conf/bzr/shallow=true)

- verify that every needed bit of information is in the config file: ```verify``` action (only skeleton implementation present)
